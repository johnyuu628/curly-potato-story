David walked down the street, breathing in the autumn air. The sun was
shining, the birds were chirping, and the leaves were beginning to change.
David couldn't help but think to himself how beautiful of a day it was when he saw it.
It was a potato, but no ordinary potato, this starch was unique as it wasn't the normal
ovalesque shape. 
Completely bewildered, David decided to get a closer look. As he approached it,
the specific, curly shape came into view. He had never seen anything remotely
like this before, so the only logical choice was for him to pocket it.
Although the spud had the look of a potato other than the shape, something else seemed off
about it. As it sat in his pocket, he could have sworn he felt it move. Almost as if it
were pulsating gently.
After what felt like an eternity, David finally reached his home. He was both nervous and
excited to find out what the potato was. Hand shaking slightly, David reached into his pocket
and pulled the potato out. It was pulsating a little more rapidly than before, he noticed.
As he extended his other hand, David poked the potato slightly. It felt like a normal potato, but
the pulsating quickened ever so slightly. Then, David noticed something even stranger. The
potato began to open what looked like eyes.
